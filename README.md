twittertrends
=============

A university project for the course Algorithm Design II, consuming the twitter streaming API and using various algorithms to extract data.

Due to restrictions on twitter's firehose (and our possible capacity), we will be using data from the [sample endpoint](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/sample).
