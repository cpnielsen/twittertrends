\subsection{Finding frequent items}\label{algo-frequent}
Ideally, we want to find the the frequency of topics in $tweets$ in our input stream $\sigma = \langle a_{1}, a_{2},...,a_{m}\rangle$, and define a frequency vector $f = (f_{1},...,f_{n})$, where $f_{1} + ... + f_{n} = m$. 

To find the exact frequency of each topic would require that we store the exact number of times it has been seen, and with the vast number of topics seen (see section \ref{algo-data}) it would require a large amount of space to store. Instead, we can find the most frequent items seen over a period of time using the $Misra-Gries$ algorithm.\cite{Amit}

From the algorithm we have  $f_j - \frac{m}{k} \leq \hat{f_j} \leq f_j$

A similar scoring method is suggested where a topic is given a score based on the frequency over a period of time. That means that if a topic generally has a high frequency over a long period of time, it will not necessarily be considered trending if a topic with a lower frequency gained it over a shorter period of time. The standard score is defined as $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$, where $x$ is the raw score, $\mu$ is the mean of the population and $\sigma$ is the standard of the population.
