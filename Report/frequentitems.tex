\subsection{Finding frequent items}\label{algo-frequent}
Ideally, we want to find the frequency of topics in $tweets$ in our input stream $\sigma = \langle a_{1}, a_{2},...,a_{m}\rangle$, and define a frequency vector $f = (f_{1},...,f_{n})$, where $f_{1} + ... + f_{n} = m$. 

To find the exact frequency of each topic would require that we store the exact number of times it has been seen, and with the vast number of topics seen (see section \ref{algo-data}) it would require a large amount of space to store. Instead, we can find the most frequent items seen over a period of time using the \textit{Misra-Gries} algorithm.\cite{Amit}

From the algorithm we have $f_j - \frac{m}{k} \leq \hat{f_j} \leq f_j$. From this we can derive that any item with a $\hat{f_j} > \frac{m}{k}$ will be in our map $A[j]$ with a positive score, and we simply need to make sure the topics we wish to capture for a given time period are above the $\frac{m}{k}$ threshold.
