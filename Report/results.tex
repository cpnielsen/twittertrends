\subsection{Comparison with Twitters trending topics}\label{twitter-result}
The results may differ from Twitters official trending topics for various reasons, which include but are not limited to the following: 
\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Twitters trend emphasizes novelty over popularity. This means that topics that have a high increase in frenquency over a short period of time are rated higher than topics that are always popular like \#android and \#gameinsight. 
	\item We only have access to a sample of all public tweets which is not guaranteed to be statistical accurate representation.
\end{enumerate}

By a quick comparison with the top-10 trending topics on Twitter with our results, it shows that there indeed exists some overlap of topics, but it is hard to define how much precisely.
