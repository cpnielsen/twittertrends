\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
We make use of the Twitter streaming API to implement our own version of trending topics using the Misra-Gries algorithm, and for the trending topics we track how many unique tweets have been made per topic, using one of the algorithms for counting distinct elements. 
\\\\
One of the main challenges of the Misra-Gries algorithm is finding a suitable k that is a good trade-off between memory space and making sure we take into account the tweets inbetween the actual trending topics that might ``flood'' them out of the array.
\\\\
For the distinct value counting algorithm we similarly need to find a good hashing algorithm for tweets, and based on this find a good number for kth-minimum distances that gives us a realistic count for unique tweets.

\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{twitter} gives an introduction to the Twitter terminology and ways users can interact with each other. The streaming model is described in Section~\ref{related work}, followed by the algorithm design and analysis in Section~\ref{algo-data}. Our results are described in Section~\ref{results}. Finally, we discuss our findings in Section~\ref{conclusions} .
