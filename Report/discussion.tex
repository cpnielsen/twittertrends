\subsection{Trending vs popular}\label{trending-discussion}

From our results, we can see that between our 1-hour and 24-hour data mining period a lot of the same topics were in the top10. One thing $Misra-Gries$ does not take into account is whether a topic is new or old within a given period - if a topic occurs more frequently than our threshold at the beginning of our time period, it will remain there for the remainder of the period. An alternative to $Misra-Gries$ would be the $Lossy Counting$ algorithm. It works in similar ways, but topics found earlier in the stream are more likely to get pruned than topics found later in the steam, which gives topics is mentioned over a very short period of time a higher value than topics that have been less, but more regularly, mentioned over a longer period.

We can conclude that our chosen algorithm
